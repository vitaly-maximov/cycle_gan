# Cycle GAN project
A study project to make PyTorch implementation for unpaired image-to-image translation based on:<br>
https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

A notebook was created to go through the original article step by step:<br>

An attempt to reproduce horse2zebra results was made:

Also a dataset with Rerih images and random pencil drawings of mountains was prepared to make a drawing look like a Rerih masterpiece:
